# Conway's Game of Life 

This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life in F# using [Bolero](https://github.com/fsbolero/Bolero), which runs a compiled F# assembly entirely in Web Assembly. This is different from [F# Fable](https://fable.io) which transpiles to Javascript.

There are no limitations on what portions of the library, rather any library can be used in Bolero, as evidenced by the use of `Array2D` functions.
